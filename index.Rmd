10 am - 12 pm   | **Co-instructors**: Thomas Van Zuiden and Katie Florko

##General Information

The purpose of this workshop is to provide tools for a new/novice analyst to more effectively and efficiently analyse their data in R. This hands-on workshop will introduce the basic concepts of R and use of generalized linear models in R to describe patterns. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own problems.

**Who**: The course is aimed at R beginners and novice to intermediate analysts. You do not need to have previous knowledge of R.

**Where**: 88 Pond Road, York University. Room 2114 DB (TEL). [Google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/fLeskquHNZs)

**Requirements**: Participants should bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) with administrative privileges. If you want to work along during tutorial, you must have R studio installed on your own computer. However, you are still welcome to attend because all examples will be presented via a projector in the classroom. Coffees and cookies provided for free.

## Software

####R

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).
